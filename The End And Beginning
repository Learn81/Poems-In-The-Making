THE END AND BEGINNING 
Knowledge of the unknown impossible to understand if this mystery lives above the mind the one must die to find. 
To Walk through this vertex the old self must be left behind, but if one returns you will be blessed for all time.
If it's god you seek, in this being won't be a name, cause all are one in the same. 
The tree of life is your body that Aches because your body is limited to this plain of pain; 
Only to the limitations of the mind in what you believe to be true will be true, 
evil actions have no rest always in state of hatred and stress; 
pay back is at its best when it comes time to collect. 


FIRST BORN 
When I the first born, came to life and tasted the first coldness that’s when I told the 
first lie. Only fools dream of a better life when the doors eternal life 
slam shut on you only to have missed the first tide, but these trees do stand up to a perfect light. 
Did the tick stop the tock when you forgot how to talk? The clock times you only when you’re 
alive so tell me, “ Time”,  when is the end of life. 

 
Whatever is taken will be left, whatever is spoken was unknown to the body with muscular overtones.
Whatever you’ve have lost will be found by the mindful energy field of creative memories. 
How can you name the creator when the creator named you before you were in the cradled?
