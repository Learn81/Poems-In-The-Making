THE END AND BEGINNING 
Knowledge of the unknown impossible to understand if this mystery lives above the mind the one must die to find. 
To Walk through this vertex the old self must be left behind, but if one returns you will be blessed for all time.
If it's god you seek, in this being won't be a name, cause all are one in the same. 
The tree of life is your body that Aches because your body is limited to this plain of pain; 
Only to the limitations of the mind in what you believe to be true will be true, 
evil actions have no rest always in state of hatred and stress; 
pay back is at its best when it comes time to collect.
